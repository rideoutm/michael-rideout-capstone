# Restaurant Annabelle

#### Welcome to my capstone project for Brainstation's web development diploma. Restaurant Annabelle was created with the intention of becoming a website theme for real world restaurants.

Restaurant Annabelle is currently deployed and can be viewed at:

## API's used

- Intersection observer API was used to trigger SCSS animations when scrolled into view.
- Leaflet.js API was used to implement the map on the contact page.

## Phase 2

- A backend server and API were originally intended to be implemented in phase 1 of this design. Due to unforeseen, last minute scheduling changes, this has been moved to phase 2. The API will dynamically feed data to the reviewsSlider component as seen on the bottom of the welcome page.
- Add an "About" page that goes into greater detail regarding the restaurant's history, team etc.
- Make necessary code refactoring to have the template function with WordPress.

## Installation

- Clone the Front-end repo from your terminal using `$ git clone https://github.com/rideoutm/michael-rideout-capstone
- You will need to then run `npm i` to download all the node moduals
- To load the template on your local server, run `npm start` from your terminal
- the template will be visible from `localhost:3000`.
